# NJ Online Store

## Project Description

NJ Online Store is a **full-featured web application** designed for e-commerce. It allows users to browse products, select sizes and colors, and manage their purchases. Admins can manage products, categories, tags, sizes, and colors, and handle user subscriptions. The system supports **flexible product pricing** based on size, color, or both, and provides **email notifications** for user actions like account creation.

This backend powers a responsive and scalable online store, ready to integrate with a modern frontend like Next.js.
